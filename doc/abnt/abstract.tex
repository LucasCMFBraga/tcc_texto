\hspace*{3em}
Most of the energy generated today comes from unsustainable sources such as fossil fuels and nuclear fission. These sources are responsible for increasing the effects of pollution, causing irreversible climate changes and eventually will be completely consumed. Therefore, research in the area of renewable energy generation is an integral part of advancing modern energy consumption to a more sustainable level, and companies and industries have begun to consider the potential of generating this type of energy, which depends on several phenomena. complex weather conditions. The task of analyzing potential generation is not a trivial matter and requires a specialized system for accurate results and several modern technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) and Artificial Intelligence can be used to further enhance product quality. This project aims to develop a complete system for this application including data acquisition, storage, information processing and user interface. The methods used to create this edge-to-edge solution were chosen considering the use of emerging technologies and the applicability of the knowledge acquired throughout the course.
